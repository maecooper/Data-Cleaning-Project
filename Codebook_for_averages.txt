Description of the Data:
The data come from experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc and tGravityAcc) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

Finally, the mean value was taken across all measurements for each subject/activity.

Data Dictionary 

Identifying Variables: activity and subject

activity: The activity the subject was doing when measurements were taken (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, or LAYING)
subject: An id number (1-30) for the experimental subject who did the activities.

Measurments:

Each variable begins with with either the letter t or f. 't' indicates that the measuremnt is a time domain signal, while 'f' indicates that it is a frequency domain signal.

_X,_Y, and _Z are used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions, respectively.

_mean indicates that the variable is an average of the mean (a mean of means).
_std indicates that the variable is and average of the standard deviations for that measurement.

BodyAcc: body acceleration signal
GravityAcc: gravity acceleration signal
BodyAccJerk: body jerk signal
BodyGyro: body gyro signal
BodyGyroJerk: body gyro jerk signal
BodyAccMag: body acceleration magnitude
GravityAccMag: gravity acceleration magnitude
BodyAccJerkMag: body jerk magnitude
BodyGyroMag: body gyro magnitude
BodyGyroJerkMag: body gyro jerk magnitude

Additional vectors were obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample.
