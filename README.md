# Data-Cleaning-Project
Project for data cleaning course

Last updated: Sept 18, 2019

Purpose:
This project takes messy data on wearable tech and cleans it into a more usable form using R.

Process:
The data for this project is available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

After downloading the data, unzip it into a folder. Set that folder as your working directory.

Once the working directory is set, you can run script "run_analysis.R" to create a tidy dataset ready for analysis.
There is a statement at the end of the script (that is commented out) that saves the dataset to your working directory as "average_data.txt".

The codebook for this dataset is available in this repository as "Codebook_for_averages.txt"

Original documentation for the data (README and features_info) have been uploaded to the repository as well, for reference.
